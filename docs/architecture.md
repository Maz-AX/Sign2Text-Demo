# System Architecture

## Overview
Sign2Text implements a distributed architecture designed for scalability, reliability, and real-time performance.

## Core Components

### Frontend (Flutter/Android)
- Material Design 3 implementation
- Provider pattern for state management
- Camera integration
- Secure authentication flow
- Cross-platform compatibility

### ML Pipeline
- Input Processing:
  - Image normalization
  - Size standardization (224x224)
  - RGB processing
- Model Architecture:
  - CNN-based architecture
  - Real-time inference optimization
  - Confidence scoring

### Performance Optimizations
1. Frontend
   - Lazy loading
   - Image compression
   - State management optimization
   - Caching implementation

2. Backend
   - Request batching
   - Response optimization
   - Connection pooling
   - Auto-scaling support

## Security Implementation
- JWT-based authentication
- Secure image transmission
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Data encryption
